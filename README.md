If you are adding yourself to this log, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub account.
2. Using the existing student pages as an example, create a page named `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.markdown`. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can use you `<LINKEDIN_USERNAME>.markdown`.
3. Only add information you are comfortable sharing on this list. This is a **PUBLIC** website. You may include the following:

    - First and last name
    - GutHub link
    - LinkedIn link
    - Other social links (Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, LinkTree, YouTube)
    - Link to your portfolio

5. Using an existing class page as an example, add your name to each appropriate list. Link your name to your student page. For example my student page would be `students/codeadam`. Notice the `markdown` extension is not required.
6. Submit a pull request.
