If you are adding yourself to this log, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repo to your GitHub account.
2. Using the existing student pages as an example, create a page named `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.markdown` and put it in the `students` folder. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can use `<LINKEDIN_USERNAME>.markdown`. For example my page would be named `codeadam.markdown`.
3. Add an image to the `images` folder named `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.jpg`. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can use you `<LINKEDIN_USERNAME>.png`. The syntax to add your image to your page is:

   ```markdown
   ![<GITHUB_USERNAME>](images/<GITHUB_USERNAME>.jpg)
   ```

   For example, mine would look something like this:

   ```markdown
   ![codeadamca](images/codeadam.png)
   ```

   Images are 40 x 40 pixels. Images can be png, jpg, or gif.
   
5. Only add information you are comfortable sharing on this list. This is a **PUBLIC** website. You may include the following:

    > **Warning**  
    > Do NOT add your email or phone number!

6. Using an existing class page as an example, add your name to each appropriate list. Link your name to your student page. For example my student page would be `students/codeadam`. Notice the `markdown` extension is not required.
